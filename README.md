# hello-springboot-neo4j
A Simple Application using Spring Boot, Spring Data to use a neo4j Database. As a prerequisite the neo4j (Community Edition) must be installed, since this approach is not using the embedded database. Access to the database is configurable and can be adapted by setting the system properties neo4j.server (server url), neo4j.username and neo4j.password.
